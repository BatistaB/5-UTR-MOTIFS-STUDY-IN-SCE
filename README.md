Hello,

It's a simple README. This code was used to training my data analysis skills using biological information.
I tryied to found some pattern in 5'-UTR genes of high expressed genes from a transcriptome data. 
It was helpfull to me understand how manipulate different biological data banks anda panda skills.


The conclusion was:

CONCLUSION:
- I cannot extract an obvious pattern from the analysis of DNA MOTIFS in the 5' UTR region of the up/down regulated genes.
- I have learned to use various tools such as KEGG, DNA MOTIF, RNA-SEQ DESEQ2.
- I have extensively utilized my pandas skills.

This pipeline addresses questions such as:

- Identifying MOTIFs in various sequences, including 5' UTR, promoters, RBS, etc.
- Cross-referencing these data with transcriptomes to identify regulatory regions.
- Identifying protein-binding regions for regulatory proteins.
